/*
Pros:

    Object is created only if it is needed. It may overcome resource overcome and wastage of CPU time.
    Exception handling is also possible in method.

Cons:
    Every time a condition of null has to be checked.
    instance can’t be accessed directly.
    In multithreaded environment, it may break singleton property.
